Secure WordPress control, content administration and conversion connector for Harika.

== Description ==

Harika Connector is the universal WordPress-side connector for websites managed through Harika. The same plugin can be installed on different customer websites; customer separation and Google provider credentials remain in the central Harika platform.

It supports authenticated inventory/content reads and controlled WordPress, Rank Math and YOOtheme changes with preview, approval binding, verification and rollback.

Version 1.2 adds a draft-first content administration surface for preparing new content without bypassing the approval boundary for published content. It can create public post types as draft, pending or private, manage public taxonomies, read and update ACF data on unpublished content, work with image media and set featured images.

Direct publication is intentionally not available through the draft-first surface. Existing published content continues to use the preview/approval/apply workflow.

Google Ads, GA4 and Search Console credentials are never stored in this WordPress plugin. Those provider connections are managed centrally by Harika.

Tracking is disabled until advertising consent is explicitly provided by the website consent integration.

Supported normalized signals include approved phone, email and WhatsApp clicks, opt-in form submissions and manual lead/conversion events.

Raw form contents, names, email addresses, phone numbers, message bodies and uploaded files are not forwarded by the plugin.

== Installation ==

1. Install harika-wordpress-connector-v1.4.1.zip on the customer WordPress website. The same bytes are also published as harika-wordpress-connector.zip and ccf-sites-ads-connector.zip so an already installed connector can update.
2. Activate Harika Connector and open Settings > Harika Connector.
3. Choose Mit Harika verbinden and use your existing Harika account with access to this website.
4. Complete the guided connection. Both directions must be verified. Existing manual connections retain their configuration.
5. Verify the YOOtheme consent mapping or connect another consent manager to window.CCFGoogleAds.setConsent().
6. Mark only approved forms for form-submit tracking.

The same plugin package is used for every customer website. Google Ads, GA4 and Search Console are selected centrally in the customer's Harika workspace and do not require additional WordPress plugins.

See README.md in the project repository for the complete configuration and production checklist.

== Privacy ==

The plugin intentionally minimizes the event payload. Page and referrer URLs have query strings/fragments removed. Advertising click identifiers are handled only after advertising consent and are not persisted by this adapter in cookies or local storage.

== Security ==

The site token is server-side only. Browser requests use a short-lived same-origin bootstrap signature before WordPress forwards an event to the control service. Production control endpoints must use HTTPS.

Content-administration calls use the same signed server-to-server control boundary. Media import is limited to public HTTPS image sources and blocks private/reserved destinations, unsupported MIME types and files larger than 10 MB. Published content cannot be modified or trashed through the direct draft-first endpoints.
