# Changelog

All notable changes to the Harika Connector are documented here.

## 1.4.1 - 2026-10-29

- Redirect the old settings URL before WordPress checks whether its menu page exists.
- Refresh server-rendered actions when pairing verification finishes, so a verified connection no longer shows the pending-attempt cancellation label.
- Add regression coverage for admin navigation, access restrictions and polling completion (Harika #527).

## 1.4.0 - 2026-10-29

- Add guided WordPress pairing through existing Harika rights, PKCE and one-time state.
- Keep site credentials encrypted on the servers; show verified only after both connection directions match.
- Preserve prior connections during failure recovery and prevent legacy fallback after activation or revocation.
- Keep the installed directory, option names, encryption context and update identity compatible.
- Release only after the matching Harika API, gateway and Control service are ready (Harika #527).

## 1.3.16

- Add a signed, read-only `/ccf-sites/v1/connection` endpoint that probes the Harika control service without emitting conversion events.
- Expose only identity, endpoint and bounded verification status; reject missing/mismatched token, site, environment, host and challenge.
- Keep legacy plugin slug, ZIP aliases and WordPress auto-update semantics unchanged.

## 1.3.15 - 2026-10-12

- Shorten the settings help. The values are copied from the website in Harika.
- Keep the field labels and the site-token status.

## 1.3.14 - 2026-10-08

- Explain on the WordPress settings screen that the connector values belong to the website in Harika, not to the customer master data.
- Show the environment as Produktion, Staging, or Entwicklung, matching the website environment in Harika.
- Say when a value comes from server configuration instead of the saved field.

## 1.3.13 - 2026-10-08

- Name the release package `harika-wordpress-connector-v<version>.zip`, matching the tag.
- Keep attaching `harika-wordpress-connector.zip` and `ccf-sites-ads-connector.zip` so connectors already installed can download this release.
- Prefer the versioned package when a release contains more than one filename.

## 1.3.12 - 2026-10-08

- Rename the PHP classes to `Harika_*` and publish `harika-wordpress-connector.zip`.
- Keep attaching `ccf-sites-ads-connector.zip` and keep the installed plugin directory `ccf-google-ads-site-connector`, so an existing site updates without deactivating.
- Prefer `harika-wordpress-connector.zip` when both package names are on the release. Connectors that still request the previous filename keep working.
- Leave `wp-config` constants, REST namespaces, stored options, request headers, and `window.CCFGoogleAds` unchanged. Installed sites and the running control services already use those names.

## 1.3.11 - 2026-10-07

- Publish releases as `harika-wordpress-connector-v<version>`.
- Keep accepting the existing `wordpress-v<version>` tags, including `wordpress-v1.3.10`.

## 1.3.10 - 2026-10-07

- Rename the installable connector to Harika Connector.
- Point the release channel at `cemfirat/harika-wordpress-connector` and keep accepting the previous repository URL until existing sites have updated.
- Keep the WordPress plugin slug and the `ccf-sites-ads-connector.zip` asset name so an installed connector updates in place.

## 1.3.9 - 2026-10-07

- Publish Harika connector 1.3.9 as the installable WordPress package.
- Carry the WordPress 6.0 requirement and package text domain into the release asset. Those header fields landed after `wordpress-v1.3.8` and were not part of that runtime package.
- Leave control, content, tracking, and updater behavior unchanged.

## 1.3.8 - 2026-09-22

- Add performance inventory for CCF diagnostics.
- Keep the installable WordPress package and GitHub release asset at the existing 1.3.8 runtime version.
- Repository-only documentation and shared branding changes made after the release do not change the packaged plugin version.
